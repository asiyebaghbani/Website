                            <p>
                            My journey in AI and data science began with a strong foundation in transportation analytics, 
                            where I applied data-driven solutions to optimize mobility and urban planning. As a 
                            Data Scientist | Transportation Planner at Iriana Co, I worked on predictive modeling and optimization, 
                            leveraging machine learning to solve real-world challenges.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Seeking to deepen my expertise, I transitioned to the Traffic Lab at IUST, where 
                            I worked as both a Data Scientist and Researcher. While my focus expanded into research, 
                            I continued developing machine learning models for transportation systems, improving 
                            forecasting, demand analysis, and network optimization. This phase strengthened 
                            my ability to bridge practical applications and research-driven AI innovations.
                            </p>

                            <p>    
                            In 2021, I took a major step forward by joining BusPas Inc. in Montreal as a Machine Learning 
                            Scientist | AI Engineer, focusing on deep learning, AI-powered mobility solutions, and 
                            scalable machine learning models. This role allowed me to integrate cutting-edge AI techniques 
                            into real-world transportation problems, pushing the boundaries of intelligent mobility solutions.

                                    AI thrives through knowledge sharing and teamwork. I actively mentor students, researchers, and 
                                    professionals, guiding them in AI model development, research methodologies, and technical 
                                    problem-solving. Fostering an innovative and inclusive AI community is a core part of my work.

                                                In this study, we propose Multi-Component Spatial Temporal Graph Attention Convolution Neural Network (Multi-STGAC), a graph deep learning model to predict short-term bus passenger flow. It incorporates a Graph Attention Network and a Graph Convolution Neural Network to consider spatial correlations in bus network data.
